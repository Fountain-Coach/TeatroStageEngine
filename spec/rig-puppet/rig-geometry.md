The puppet’s proportions mirror the Three.js demo, which uses box bodies of various sizes. In the Swift engine we represent bodies as points, but the same dimensions are used by renderers to draw box outlines.

Approximate body extents (Three.js reference):
- Bar: width 10, height 0.2, depth 0.2, centered at `(0, 15, 0)`.
- Torso: width 1.6, height 3, depth 0.8, centered at `(0, 8, 0)`.
- Head: width 1.1, height 1.1, depth 0.8, centered at `(0, 10, 0)`.
- Hands: width 0.4, height 2.0, depth 0.4, centered near `(-1.8, 8, 0)` and `(1.8, 8, 0)`.
- Feet: width 0.5, height 2.2, depth 0.5, centered near `(-0.6, 5, 0)` and `(0.6, 5, 0)`.

Masses:
- Bar: light mass (~0.1) so it responds smoothly to the drive function but influences the rig.
- Torso: heavier (~1.0), the main inertia of the puppet.
- Head: medium (~0.5).
- Hands: light (~0.3).
- Feet: medium (~0.4).

Exact numbers used in `TPPuppetRig` should be kept in sync with this file. Adjustments for feel (e.g. slightly heavier feet) are allowed but must be recorded here.
