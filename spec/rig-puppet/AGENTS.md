This directory owns the specification of the Teatro Fadenpuppe rig: which bodies exist, how they are connected, and what their geometry is. The Swift rig (`TPPuppetRig`) and the Three.js demo must both reflect this description.

Files here document:
- the rig’s topology (`rig-topology.md`),
- the numeric geometry and masses (`rig-geometry.md`).

Changes to the puppet’s structure, masses, or attachment points must be mirrored here so that all renderers and tools have a single source of truth.
