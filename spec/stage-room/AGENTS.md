This directory defines the geometry of the Teatro stage room: floor, walls, and door. Renderers are responsible for drawing these shapes, but they must use the same numbers so that the puppet appears in the same place and scale as in the reference demos.

Files:
- `room-geometry.md` — numeric dimensions and coordinates.
- `coordinate-conventions.md` — how room and rig coordinates align.
