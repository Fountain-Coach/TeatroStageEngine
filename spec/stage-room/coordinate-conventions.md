The room and rig share a world:

- Puppet feet rest near the floor plane (`y ≈ 5` with leg lengths bringing soles close to `y = 0`).
- The rig is centered in X at 0 and slightly forward or backward in Z as desired; the reference puppet stands near the center of the floor.
- The camera looks at `(0, 5, 0)`, which is slightly above the puppet’s midsection and near the center of the room.

When integrating with other instruments (constellation fields, additional props), use these coordinates as the stage’s “home position” so that new elements appear with sensible scale and location relative to the puppet.
