This directory defines the Teatro stage visual style: paper colour, line colours and thickness, and the shapes and tones of lights. It does not mandate a renderer, but it gives enough information for Metal, WebGL, or SVG implementations to look recognisably “Teatro”.

Files:
- `colors-and-lines.md` — palette and line weights.
- `lighting-shapes.md` — description of the floor spot and back‑wall wash.
