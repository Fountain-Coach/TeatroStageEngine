Palette (reference from Three.js demo):

- Paper background: `#f4ead6` — warm off‑white.
- Line colour: `#111111` — near‑black for room edges and puppet outlines.
- Highlight line (door inset, string highlights): same hue but can be drawn slightly thinner or lighter.

Line weights:
- Edges should read as hairline but remain visible at typical desktop window sizes (e.g. 1–2 logical pixels).
- Strings may be slightly thinner than room edges to emphasise delicacy.
- Renderers should avoid overly heavy strokes; the stage should feel like a fine ink drawing on paper.

Background:
- Background is flat; no gradients.
- The stage should sit comfortably in the centre of the viewport with generous margins to avoid claustrophobia.
