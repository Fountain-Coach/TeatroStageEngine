The Teatro puppet stage uses simple, abstract light shapes to suggest focus:

- Floor spot:
  - Circular or slightly elliptical patch centred beneath the puppet.
  - Radius ≈ 4 units, with 2–3 concentric rings fading outward.
  - Colour near `#f9f0e0` with low contrast against paper.

- Back‑wall wash:
  - Rectangle on the back wall centred behind the puppet, roughly 12 units wide and 8 units tall.
  - Colour near `#f7efe0`, even lighter than the floor spot.

Lights are not physically simulated; they are compositional cues. Renderers should treat them as flat shapes aligned to the room surfaces, not as volumetric cones.
